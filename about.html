                My name is <b>NOORDINI AKILAH BINTI MUHYIDIN,</b> a student from the <b>DIPLOMA OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</b> final semester. In this assignment, I was required to create my own personal website using HTML and CSS. This assignment will use the skills and knowledge gained in this course to design a static web page that reflects the student's personal brand.

                This website was created to complete the individual subject assignment <b>IMD311 (INTRODUCTION TO WEB CONTENT MANAGEMENT AND DESIGN)</b>, which was taught by <b>MADAM SERI INTAN IDAYU BINTI SHAHRUL ASARI</b>. I am grateful because she gave me a lot of guidance on this assignment. In addition, I am also grateful to the websites of Aqmal Yazid and Aina Munirah, who have inspired me to design this webpage. Not forgetting the friends who helped a lot to complete this task.
