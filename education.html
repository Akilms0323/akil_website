            I was in this primary school from kindergarten to 6th grade. This school only has one class for each class because it doesn't have many students. This SKKP was established for two villages, namely the Kampung Orang Asli Kuala Pangsun and Kampung Kuala Pangsun (Malay and Indonesian). For each class, the number of students will not exceed 20 people. Because the natives also do not send them to this school because there is a Chinese national school. All this happened in my time. I don't know the latest developments about this school. At this school, I made many friends and was also active in extracurricular activities. And I ended up taking UPSR here, with UPSR results: 2A, 2B, 1C

            SMAJA is located at BT14 Hulu Langat, Selangor. I am in this high school and live in a dormitory provided by the school. From this high school, I got to know many friends who helped me more in the English subject. From form 1 to form 3, I took the stream of commerce. Form 4â€“5: I took the stream of principles of accounting, economics, and business. In this school, I have many memories with friends who are always there and with teachers who always understand students and are ready to help. I finished my teenage years with SPM results 5A, 2B, and 2C.

                Growing up in a family deeply rooted in the management of a catering business, I garnered extensive experience handling finances, food preparation, and providing exceptional customer service. This exposure not only honed my financial acumen and culinary skills but also cultivated my innate ability to engage effortlessly with customers, making me an approachable and personable individual. Moreover, I expanded my expertise while working at a renowned restaurant frequented by cyclists, where I assumed the role of a waiter during the interim period while awaiting my SPM results.
